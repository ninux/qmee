\chapter*{About}
This is a personal solutions manual and notebook for the self-study of
\emph{Quantum Mechanics for Electrical Engineers} by Dennis M. Sullivan.

The solutions and notes presented in this work are my personal ones. I have
tried to use this work to help myself for better comprehension of the topic
and to provide other insight to solution approaches that differ from the
original author's solutions manual.

One major difference to the authors solution manual is that I use GNU Octave
instead of MATLAB. While those two tools are very similar, there are some
subtle differences in syntax and specific coding options. I have tried to
follow the GNU Octave Style-Guide, however, I have some personal preferences,
e.g. indentation of 4 instead of 2 characters.
